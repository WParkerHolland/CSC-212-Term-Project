Topic: String Search I \n

## Purpose of our Project
It has been known that U.S. legislators do not read every bill that they must vote on. This is understandable when bills can be dozens of pages long and legislators are often busy. However, it does not mean that legislators should not do anything to inform themselves about bills they vote on. To help the legislators learn more about what they vote on, we aim to develop two different string searching algorithms and find which is more efficient. These algorithms will allow legislators to search for phrases in lengthy bills that pertain to their constituents. The efficiency of the algorithm is important because as stated earlier, legislators are busy and have no time for inefficient algorithms. \n
This program will read data from the text tab of legislation found on the U.S. Senate's official website (https://www.senate.gov/legislative/active_leg_page.htm), which contains all active legislation in the 118th Congress. Once the specific bill and phrase is provided, the program will perform both a Rabin-Karp and a Boyer-Moore string search and compare the benchmarks of the two algorithms graphically.

## Who does what
Jad Alsassa - Designs main.cpp, which combines all other algorithms and will read data from a website to use for string searching \n
Caleb Cady - Develops the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm and anything else needed for it \n
Parker Holland - Develops the Rabin-Karp string search algorithm and writes the readme file \n
Owen Cunnie - Designs the files for the benchmarking and graphing of results for each search algorithm \n

## How to use
TBD
